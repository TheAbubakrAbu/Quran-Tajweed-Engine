# which a chrome space counts as a separator - a floor, not the whole answer. The two
# constants were read off the older volumes, whose text block starts at y=127 and ends at
# y=653. Abu Ja'far's volumes set their block tighter: on 61 Ibn Wardan pages and 26 Ibn
# Jammaz pages the top line lands at y=113.9-114.4, just under the 115 floor, so every
# space on it was thrown away and the whole line printed as one word - 60 and 27 ayahs,
# e.g. 4:7 `لِّلرِّجَالِنَصِيبٞمِّمَّاتَرَكَالۡوَٰلِدَٰنِ...`, concentrated in surahs 4-6 and 12-18.
#
# So the band is widened per page to whatever the Quran faces (HQPB*/Hamd*) actually
# cover, plus 4pt of slack for the separator's own baseline offset. It only ever grows,
# and it grows off the body text itself, so the furniture cannot creep in with it: the
# header is drawn in the MSH layer and the footer in DecoType, neither of which is
# consulted here. Measured over all 17 volumes, this admits 628 spaces in Ibn Wardan and
# 289 in Ibn Jammaz and changes nothing at all anywhere else - no volume loses a space,

# as the real alef it is in the body (74:33 `إِذَا دَبَرَ`).
#
# The threshold has to be RELATIVE. It used to be an absolute 18pt, read off the Kufi
# volumes (body 12-14pt, banner 20pt). The Madani and Basri volumes set their body at
# 16-18.5pt, so that constant silently deleted their whole MSH layer wherever a page happened
# to be typeset at 18pt - and in those volumes MSH carries the AYAH NUMBERS (gids 19-28 are
# the digits 0-9). Ibn Wardan lost the numbers of 24 ayahs that way, nine of them consecutive
